		APACHE2 SERVER CONFIGURATION PHP, MYSQL, PHPMYADMIN AND MORE...

=======================================================================================

Hello,

I thought it would be nice to make a guide to configure apache2 on a rapsberry
(pi 3 B) with PHP and MySQL.
Also, you can find another directory I made to configure a self-signed ssl
certificate with openssl called "apache2-ssl".
In this tutorial, I will show you how to install successively :
+ apache2
+ php
+ MySQL
+ phpmyadmin

I will also cover the specifics of apache2 and give you some useful commands
to check and test your configuration.

I will also show you what the configurations of apache files are, such as :
+ apache2.conf
+ sites-available.conf
+ ports.conf
+ /etc/hosts
+ etc...

The ssl configuration files will soon come in the directory "apache2-ssl".

Enjoy it and hope to be helpfull !
